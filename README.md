# Type Converter GUI 

## Overview

The _ConverterGUI.java_ file is a standalone, simple application used to perform type conversions on basic types. Users may enter numbers in a variety of bases (e.g. hex, octal) and convert these values to their corresponding values in other bases. Additional support is included to render RGB colors and their converted binary values in IEEE 'float' standard format.
